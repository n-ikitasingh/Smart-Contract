# Smart-Contract
## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in a Solidity Smart Contract. These statements are used for error handling and ensuring that certain conditions are met before executing specific functions.

## Smart Contract
The contract includes three functions:
1. **checkRequire()**: Uses `require()` to validate input.
2. **checkAssert()**: Uses `assert()` to check for invariants.
3. **checkRevert()**: Uses `revert()` to revert the transaction under certain conditions.

## Usage
To deploy and interact with the contract:
1. Deploy the contract on a test network (e.g., Ropsten, Kovan).
2. Use a tool like Remix or Truffle to interact with the contract functions.
3. Observe the behavior of each function when different conditions are met.
